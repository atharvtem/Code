# **Intelligent Product Review Sentiment Analysis Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques**

## **Project Overview**
This project develops an intelligent sentiment analysis system designed to process and analyze product reviews from e-commerce platforms. Utilizing advanced deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, the system automates sentiment classification to provide businesses with actionable insights into customer feedback.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Collection:** Automates the collection of product reviews from various e-commerce platforms using web scraping techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Employs deep learning models (RNNs, Transformers) to classify customer feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- **Visualization:** Generates interactive charts and graphs to present sentiment insights, enabling quick understanding for business stakeholders.

## **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Programming Languages:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` for deep learning models.
  - `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` for web scraping.
  - `NLTK`, `SpaCy` for text preprocessing.
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` for data visualization.
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing processed data.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies


## **Usage**
1. **Data Collection:**
- Run the web scraping scripts to collect product reviews from specified e-commerce platforms.
- Place the collected reviews in the appropriate directory for preprocessing.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
- Execute preprocessing scripts to clean the collected reviews.
- Transform data into the format required for sentiment analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
